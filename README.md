## Description
The Dataframe Explorer is a web application for exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Streamlit. It allows users to upload CSV files and analyze their data through various statistical and visualization features. This tool provides functionality to examine numeric and categorical columns, including viewing unique values, identifying missing values, and computing statistical metrics such as mean, median, standard deviation, etc.

Some of the challenges faced during development included integrating diverse data types within a single, cohesive analysis framework, ensuring compatibility with different CSV formats, and writing comprehensive tests to validate each functionâ€™s accuracy. Future features planned for implementation include enhanced data visualization options, custom filtering tools, and support for additional file formats.
